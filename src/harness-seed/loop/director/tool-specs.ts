 * It used to be a set of eight names, and the five outside it — plan, worker_status,
 * worker_steer, worker_stop and note — are exactly the calls a director makes right after
 * committing by hand: it commits, writes a note about it, and the studio still believes the
 * head is where the last integrate left it. `syncHead` returns early when nothing moved, so
 * the honest rule is the cheap one: every tool the director has. `resolve_root` is not a
 * director tool at all — it is the studio asking where a target lives — and answering it must
 * not touch git.
