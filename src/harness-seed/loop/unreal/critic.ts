/**
 * The lead's critic: fresh eyes on the lead's own captures. `critic` sends the named captures (each
 * by realpath inside the project's `Saved/Genex/captures/`), the game's `references/` stills and
 * ART.md to a fresh vision call whose rubric counts light, atmosphere, materials and composition as
 * structure, not polish. It answers at most five defects with their fixes, one bold move and its
 * yes or no to its own art checks (`CRITIC_CHECKS`, not the brief's Gate 0–2). It is advice: it
 * changes nothing in the game or the run, and the graph shows it on the round it reviewed.
