/**
 * A local session's chat mode (`local-session.ts`): which of its tool calls wait for the person
 * and how their answer reads to the model. Only a game chat's own session the person answers has a
 * mode (`DelegateRequest.permissions`); unattended work never asks. The studio runs these tools
 * itself, so it asks before each change as Claude Code does: Manual before every edit and command,
 * Accept edits before every command, Auto never; Plan refuses every change until the plan is
 * approved (the host asks for that once the turn ends: `main/core/plan-approval.ts`). Bonsai's
 * commands always run in the studio's sandbox, so it honours no Bypass (`permissionModesFor`).
 *
 * A local session never carries a worker's seat: the host seats workers only on a delegated engine
 * and offers a local session no worker tools, so work started on one runs unattended, with the
 * sibling deny list and Bonsai's commands in the studio's sandbox.
