/**
 * C++ parts on the editor's side. `landPartCpp` brings a part's code from a builder's copy into the
 * game, the editor queue's step before its hot reload. The Loop runner's two tools manage the
 * game's C++ module. `cpp-status` says whether this computer compiles Unreal C++ (a Mac whose
 * Xcode is ready), the game's module and how adding it goes. `add-cpp-module` adds the module in
 * the background, one job per project at a time: it saves the editor's work and quits Unreal (the
 * normal quit), writes the module (`cpp-module.ts`), builds it with UnrealBuildTool (`ubt.ts`) and
 * opens Unreal again, one restart of about two minutes. A project that can't take the module
 * is refused before Unreal is touched, a build that fails takes the module back out, and an editor
 * the job closed is opened again after any failure.
 *
 * Agents write the game folder and the builder's copy, so the copy follows the gate's own rules
 * (`part-files.ts`): plain `.h` and `.cpp` files at most one plain folder deep, read without
 * following a link and within the caps. Anything else in either part folder refuses the whole
 * copy before anything is written, and only the part's own folder in the game changes.
