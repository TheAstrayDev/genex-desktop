/**
 * Set up Unreal: everything Genex needs from a user's Unreal project, applied in one step so nobody
 * edits a .uproject or an ini by hand. Each piece is what had to be done by hand before:
 * - Epic's ModelContextProtocol and EditorToolset plugins on in the .uproject;
 * - the MCP server starting on the project's own port whenever the project opens, from the
 *   project's per-user `Saved/Config/<Platform>Editor/EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini`, which
 *   Unreal keeps when it rewrites that file on exit; the port is chosen once (`editor-port.ts`);
 * - the Genex editor helper copied into the project's `Plugins/` folder.
 * Engines and recent projects come from Epic's own lists. Setup refuses while Unreal Editor runs
 * (it rewrites the project's settings when it closes), never writes through a link, keeps a copy
 * of each file before its first change, and records what it changed, so Undo takes back exactly
 * that and keeps whatever the user changed since.
