/**
 * The macOS sandbox UnrealBuildTool runs in when check-part compiles a builder's copy of a game
 * (Seatbelt, through `sandbox-exec`). A builder writes the copy's C++, and UBT compiles it and runs
 * the copy's C# rules, so the build reads nothing in the user's home folder but the copy, the
 * engine, Xcode and UBT's own per-user folders; writes only the copy's build output, UBT's log
 * folder and a private scratch folder; never touches a coding CLI's sign-in home, wherever it
 * lives; has no network; and starts with none of Genex's environment. UBT finds its per-user
 * folders from the account, not from HOME, so they are named here; its configuration there is
 * read only, so a build can't plant settings for the user's own builds. A sandboxed full build
 * takes as long as an unconfined one.
