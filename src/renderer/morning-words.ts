/**
 * The morning card's copy, as a pure function.
 *
 * The card itself is React, so nothing in a test can reach it; every sentence and every button it
 * offers is decided here instead, from the facts the log carries. The four paths a night can end
 * on — landed, kept but not made live, paused, stopped by the owner — are the four the user meets,
 * and the one thing they must never disagree about is the card's own buttons: a night the card
 * says is "Finished" must not be one whose Resume is the only thing that saves it, and a sentence
 * that promises a playable build must not appear over a card with no Play on it.
