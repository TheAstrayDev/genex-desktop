/**
 * A job's gate and box, by the chat's mode: Bypass runs it in the Bypass worker's wider box, Auto in
 * the box of its write roots, Accept edits and Manual ask the person first, Plan holds it. Every box
 * denies the never-touch list for reads and writes, Claude Code's own folder in each write root for
 * writes, and the network. Pure: the box is compared with the one Claude Code's engine builds for a
 * Bypass worker of the same seat, through the engine's own interface (an injected `query()`).
